# Troll

The *troll* is a C-language source-level debugger for ARM Cortex-M systems.

Note that this is a very special case of a debugger

### From C to machine

You have your C program 'compiled'.
'Compilation' is the process of converting a program to machine code.
The output of the compiler is a blob of machine code, with some tags and perks.
In real life, you perform this many times, know or not.
When all source-code files are 'compiled', you want an 'executable' blob.

The linkage editor program creates an 'executable' out of what has already been created.
You somehow start your program.

But it is not working...

### From C to machine

The C language is existing. It is real.
